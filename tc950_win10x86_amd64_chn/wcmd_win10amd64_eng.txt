wcmd_win10amd64_1_eng.mnu and wcmd_win10amd64_2_eng.mnu are alternative menus for
TC that includes almost all the internal commands that it makes sense to use in
the menu.  Includes among others separate menu items for "Filter", "Navigate",
"Focus", "Lister", "Tabs", "FTP", "Folders" and "Misc.". Furthermore there is
a "Windows 10" menu item that holds most programs installed with Windows 10
and an extended "Help" menu item with links to Total Commander related web
pages.

wcmd_win10amd64_1_eng.mnu has a single "View" menu which is common to both file
panels.  wcmd_win10amd64_2_eng.mnu has separate "Left" and "Right" menus (like
Norton Commander).

wcmd_win10amd64_1_eng.lng and wcmd_win10amd64_2_eng.lng are (almost) identical
to TC's internal dialog, and the use of these two files makes it easy to change
language and menu at the same time with just one click - simply just choose
"English with Extended Menu I for TC 9.50 64bit under Windows 10 64bit" or
"English with Extended Menu II for TC 9.50 64bit under Windows 10 64bit" in
the language dialog.

wcmd_win10amd64_1_eng.inc and wcmd_win10amd64_2_eng.inc are slightly improved
versions of the original commands descriptions.

wcmd_win10amd64_1_eng.ini and wcmd_win10amd64_2_eng.ini are user command files
which are necessary for the user commands in the "Windows 10" and "Help" menu
entries among others.

wcmd_win10amd64_eng\*.bar is a folder with a series of button bars with the same
programs as the "Windows 10" menu item together with a button bar that shows
all the internal commands that has an icon in the wcmicons.dll file.  You can
switch between the button bars using the menu item "Windows 10".


wcmd_win10amd64_eng.zip is a self installing archive containing several Addons
for Total Commander:

1: Extended Icon Set for TC (with 48x48 icons) (wcmicon_win10amd64.dll, wcmicon_win10amd64.inc).
2: Old Style Help for TC (totalcmd.hlp, winhlp32.exe).
3: English Standalone Lister (lister.exe, lister.exe.manifest).
4: Extended File Comments for TC (descript.ion).
5: Folder Icon for TC (desktop.ini). Write protect TC's program folder to see
   the icon.
6: Official English language files (wcmd_eng.lng, wcmd_eng.mnu and
   wcmd_eng.inc).

You can install this package from the Menu: "Help" -> "Install Addons for
Total Commander".  If the files already exists, you will be asked whether
you want to overwrite them.


wcmd_win10amd64_eng.txt is this file.

About Plugins

As from version 7.55 a new item "Lister" is added to the Extended Menus.

From this item a separate version of Lister can be opened in forced view mode.
If the chosen mode is not possible with the selected file, then Total Commander
will fallback to text view or binary text view.


The following plugin/addon programs are supported in the "Lister" menu item:
